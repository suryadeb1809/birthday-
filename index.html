            Many many returns of the day ❤<br><br>
            Just remember, you’re not getting older, <br> you’re just becoming a classic—like a vintage car that needs a lot of repairs!..😆<br>
            I'm so glad we're friends!br You make me laugh, even when you're not trying to!!😏<br>
            You make my life more fun..... <br> and also more confusing, but that's okay!😊

        <p id="note">I hope your birthday is as bright as your smile or at least much more brighter than your phone screen!!!😁<br>
            Here’s another year of you will pretend to be an adult but I want that, keep your childish spirit alive. <br> May your day be filled with cake, laughter, and just the right amount of chaos! <br>
             Let’s celebrate before you need reading glasses to see the candles!💖😄<br><br>
            
            Again Happy birthday....🥳💕
